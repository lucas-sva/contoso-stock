# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.  
Instead, report it responsibly by contacting the maintainers:

- Create a private issue marked as **security**, or  
- Send an email to: lucas.sva@outlook.com

I will review and respond to security reports as quickly as possible.  
Please give me reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before disclosing it publicly.
